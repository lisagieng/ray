Some website standards:

- Please include the css/index.css file in every html file
	+ Use <body class="wrapper"> to instantiate the website standard wrapper
- Headers for sections will be sized h3
- Use <p> for content
- When using links, if they're leading to pages that are not on the website,
  open them in a new tab with target="_blank". If they're links to other pages that
  are part of the website, just leave it without the target.
